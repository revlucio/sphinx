-lint everything
-style table
-delete button
-editor config
-reliable tests
-faster tests

features:
-ask more question types
    -start with asserting 1st question, then more
-randomise values in math questions
-ask questions on a timer
-questions get harder
-question types repeat over time

the rest is harder to test!

1. I should write my own client to handle randomness when I need it to pass
2. seed it when Im testing questions themselves, or otherwise control the randomness
